1) Who is in your group?
Andrew Cash, Taylor Allen, Sam Hendryx

2) How long did the project take?
Several weeks.

3) Before you started, which data structure did you expect would be the fastest?
Probably Hash, then AVL Tree and lastly BST.

4) Which data structure is the fastest? Why were you right or wrong?
TBD

5) In general, which DataCounter dictionary implementation was "better": trees or
hash tables? Note that you will need to define "better" (ease of coding, ease of
debugging, memory usage, disk access patterns, runtime for average input, runtime
for all input, etc).


6) Are there cases in which a particular data structure performs really well or badly in
the correlator? Enumerate the cases for each data structure.

7) Give a one to two paragraph explanation of whether or not you think Bacon wrote
Shakespeare's plays based on the data you collected. No fancy statistical analysis
here.

8) What did you enjoy about this assignment? What did you hate? Could we have done
anything better?

Sam: I enjoyed the implementation of the different data structures. It really forces
you to understand how they work.

Andrew: I liked pair programming and in particular, the ablilty to bounce ideas off
of the others. I thought that it was a bit too much at once. If it had been parsed into
separate projects it would have been more easily managable.

Taylor: TBD
